## HTML Deliverable

For this deliverable, I used HTMl to build the base structure of my website. It contains
*3 pages, the first representing login, the second being a main page, and the third being a team builder page
*3 buttons that represent logging in taking you to main, new team which takes you to builder, and submit which takes you back to main
*Images representing how the main page will show teams, and how the team builder will show pokemon. I used images temporarily for the adjustable stat bars until I figure out how I will make them work
*Websocket and database is represented by the images shown on the main page and the search bar that will get the pokemon and info on the team builder page.
